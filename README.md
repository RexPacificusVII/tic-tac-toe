# Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository contains a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, otherwise known as Noughts and Crosses. This is a simple game consisting of a 3x3 grid in which players take turns making their mark (cross or circle) until either one player achieves a connected line of 3 marks or the board state prevents either player from achieving a line of 3 marks which results in a draw. More details on the rules can be found at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). 

The game is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js makes it easy to create dynamic and interactive web pages. The game also uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS makes it easy to style the game and make it look good on all devices.

This is part of the KodeGo excercises and is a good way to practice using React.js to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

## Key Features:

- **React.js**: The game is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The game is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Responsive design**: The game is responsive, meaning that it will look good and function well on all devices.

## Possible Future Improvements:

- **Single Player Mode**: Adding an option at the beginning for either single player(player vs. bot) mode or multiplayer(player vs. player) mode.
- **Player Name**: Adding an input field after mode selection for the name to be used instead of the generic Player X/O.
- **Score Tracker**: Adding a score tracker if within the same game instance (need to add a button to end the game to end the instance aside from restarting the game which only restarts the game instance).
